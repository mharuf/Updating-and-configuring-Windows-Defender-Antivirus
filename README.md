<h1>Updating and configuring Microsoft Windows Defender</h1>
I completed this project on coursera with IBM. I was taught how to navigate through the settings page of Microsoft Windows to arrive at the Virus and threat protection page, where I was taught how to update threat definitions to the latest version. I was then taught how to scan a computer for threats. Following this I was taught how to scan specific files or folders for threats.
